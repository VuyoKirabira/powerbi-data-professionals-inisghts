# üö® Power BI project with valuable insights! üö®

I have just wrapped up a power BI project where I analyzed a data professionals survey to generate beautiful visuals and insights. This survey was available worldwide, some of the countries which participated including: the USA, Canada and India.

Before I was able to create these visuals I had to clean and transform the data using power query tasks in this stage include the following to name a few:

‚ô¶Ô∏èÔ∏è Including converting the ranges( for example 104k-110k) in current yearly salary to numerical average values(for example 10700) for accurate analysis

‚ô¶Ô∏è Handling nulls and other inconsistencies.

‚ô¶Ô∏è Standardizing other columns.

‚ô¶Ô∏èChanging and validating data types across multiple tables

# A few insights include:

  1.  Data scientists are the real winners !
        Data Scientists have both highest salary and they also have the highest happiness rating with salary. No surprise there, a high salary results in an improvement in standard of living         and mood apparently!

  2. Salary satisfaction is low
      Only 4.26/10 professionals are happy with their salary.

  3. High Paying Industries for Data Scientists
      The industry which data scientists earn the most is healthcare(shared top position with telecoms) which makes sense because predicting trends of sicknesses like covid-19 is invaluable.
  
  4. Python is the most favoured language
      The language of choice for data professionals is python, a staggering 389/578 professionals chose python as their coding language of choice.

  5. Gender pay 
    In this survey on average female participants earn more than their male counterparts, females earn on average 54300 and males earn 53740 on average.

  6. USA salary tops happiness rattings
      Using the vertical list slicer we uncover that the data professionals in the USA have the highest happiness with their salary, USA having the highest GDP in the world can afford to pay        their workers higher and the presence of tech giants like FAANG being based in the US.
